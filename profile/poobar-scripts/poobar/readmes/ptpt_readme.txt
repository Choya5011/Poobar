UI panel which creates tabs based on window size and tab count.
This short readme contains instructions on items that are not fully self-explanatory.

Background:
----------
"Enable" shifts the album art away or to the tabs depending on its status:
* When enabled the art will take the full window size with the tabs and transparent overlay sitting on top of it.
* When disabled the album art will take the full window size minus the tab size & the tabs will switch to a solid color set by the color mode.
    * This shift away from the tabs will also happen when the "Blur"
      or "Default" options are picked.

The "Shadow" option is a transparent overlay for the background image that uses the color set by the color mode (e.g. system/dynamic/custom).

Selecting "Default" uses the custom image at path\to\custom\image. If this path hasn’t been changed, the properties window opens automatically so you can set the correct path. Click Apply to save changes—leaving the default path will cause drawing issues.
